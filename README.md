# Global Population Analysis

## Project Overview

Completed a comprehensive global population analysis project focusing on data manipulation with pandas, numerical analysis using NumPy, and data visualization via seaborn. Analyzed population trends from 1960 to 2022, identified regions with highest and lowest populations, and used choropleth maps for insightful visual representations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-population-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd global-population-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas
   ```

## Validation Points

Here are some validation points to ensure accuracy:

1. **Data Loading**: Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded and formatted.
2. **Data Preparation**: Verify data integrity and appropriate indexing.
3. **Yearly Mean Calculation**: Validate accuracy in calculating yearly mean populations.
4. **Identifying Regions**: Confirm correct identification of regions with highest and lowest average populations.
5. **Choropleth Maps**: Verify accurate generation of choropleth maps for visual representation.
6. **Yearly Trends**: Validate clarity and correctness of yearly population trend analysis.

## Results

Insights into global population trends from 1960 to 2022:
- Identified regional variations and growth patterns.
- Utilized choropleth maps for visual clarity and data-driven insights.
